# Conversational Analytics Demos and Tools

This repository houses a collection of demos and tools for the [Conversational Analytics API](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/conversational-analytics-api/overview). The examples herein are designed to showcase the API's capabilities and provide practical integration patterns.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The Conversational Analytics API offers a natural language interface to programmatically query data from BigQuery, Looker, and Looker Studio. This allows for the seamless integration of powerful data conversation features into your applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### [Conversational Analytics API Golden Demo](/ca-api-golden-demo/README.md)

This project provides various examples of how to integrate the Conversational Analytics API into web applications. The demos include:

- Direct Agent Querying: Shows how to directly query the Conversational Analytics agent from a web interface.
- Embedded Looker Dashboard Integration: Demonstrates how to use the API alongside an embedded Looker dashboard and share filter context.
- Multimodal Conversation with Gemini Live API: Illustrates an advanced use case, combining the Conversational Analytics API with the [Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api) for a multimodal conversational experience.

### [Conversational Analytics API with ADK](/ca-api-adk/README.md)

This project provides an examples of how to use the Conversational Analytics API with ADK. The demo includes:

- A root agent that handles the sub agents.
- An agent that uses a tool to generate insights using the CA API.
- A visualization agent that visualizes the results using a Vertex AI Code Interpreter extension and returns the plot.

### [Streaming: Conversational Analytics API with ADK](/ca-api-adk-streaming/README.md)

This project provides an example of how to use streaming with the Conversational Analytics API and ADK. The demo includes:

- A root agent that uses a custom ADK Agent class, and connects to the CA API streaming responses back asynchronously.
- Showcases examples of how to save various JSON partials from the CA API (like the viz response, or raw data result) to Agent session temp storage to be accessed by subsequent agents in the same invocation.
- Documentation on how to deploy this agent to Agent Engine or run locally
- Examples of using this Agent in a multi-agent system.
