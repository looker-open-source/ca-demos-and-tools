      If I ask you to perform cluster analysis...
      First determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette score. 
      Apply K-means clustering with the optimal number of clusters
      Then, add the cluster labels to the data. 
      Display the first 5 rows of the updated DataFrame, the number of customers in each cluster, and the cluster centers. 
      Then, generate a chart using altair to create a scatter plot with one metric on the x axis and a different metric on the y axis.
      Make the chart interactive with hover data showing customer_id and all the metrics queried. 
      Color each data point by the cluster label.
  - text: Always summarise the results and provide insights on the data retrieved.
