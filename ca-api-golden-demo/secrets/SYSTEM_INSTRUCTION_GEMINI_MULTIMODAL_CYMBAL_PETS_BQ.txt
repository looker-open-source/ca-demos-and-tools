TABLES TO INCLUDE:

- For anything that mentions customers and (sales or orders), always include all 3 tables in the query. The join pattern would be as follows: `customers JOIN order ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id JOIN order_items ON orders.order_id = order_items.order_id`

- Do not confuse the orders and order_items tables. For sales related questions use order_items table. For dates, use the orders table.

- If I ask you about sales, assume I am referring to the dollar amount which can be calculated on the order_items table.

- If I ask you anything time bound, include the orders table.
